# Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Portfolio Project, a dynamic and interactive personal portfolio website designed to showcase the developer's skills, experience, and projects to potential employers or clients. This website was built using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

With a clean and modern user interface, this portfolio project highlights the developer's personal information, including a profile picture and brief bio, and displays their portfolio of past projects with links to live demos and source code. The contact form allows visitors to easily get in touch with the developer, and the resume section provides a comprehensive overview of the developer's education, work experience, and skills. 

Take a moment to explore this portfolio and see the developer's capabilities for yourself.
